KPMG Data Analysis and Dashboard Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on performing data analysis on the KPMG dataset and building a dashboard to gain meaningful insights. The goal is to apply data analysis concepts to solve real-world business problems and improve decision-making. The project is designed to enhance data interpretation skills and prepare for machine learning roles by understanding data processing and visualization techniques.

Project Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the KPMG dataset.

Clean and preprocess the raw data.

Extract meaningful insights through visualizations.

Build an interactive dashboard for business decision-making.

Present findings in a structured and professional manner.

Checks for missing values and data types.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handles missing values.

Converts data types where necessary.

Merges datasets to create a unified analysis-ready dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Generates summary statistics.

Performs visualizations to understand trends in transactions and customer behavior.

Dashboard Development:

Prepares processed data for visualization in Power BI.

Key Insights and Findings

Customer segmentation based on demographics and transactions.

Revenue trends and customer purchasing behavior.

Identification of potential high-value customers.

Business recommendations based on data insights.

Future Enhancements
