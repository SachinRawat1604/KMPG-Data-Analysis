# KPMG Data Analysis and Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing data analysis on the KPMG dataset and building a dashboard to gain meaningful insights. The goal is to apply data analysis concepts to solve real-world business problems using a provided dataset.

## Project Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the KPMG dataset.
- Clean and preprocess the raw data.
- Extract meaningful insights through visualizations.
- Build an interactive dashboard for business decision-making.
- Present findings in a structured and professional manner.

## Dataset Information

- **File:** KPMG_VI_New_raw_data_update_final.xlsx
- **Contents:** Customer demographics, transactions, new customer lists, customer address details.
- **Format:** Excel (.xlsx)

## Files in the Repository

- `KPMG.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualization process.
- `Dashboard.pbix`: Power BI dashboard visualizing key insights.
- `KPMG_VI_New_raw_data_update_final.xlsx`: Raw dataset used for analysis.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and instructions.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For data analysis and visualization
- **Power BI:** For dashboard creation
- **Excel:** Data storage and preprocessing

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SachinRawat1604/KMPG-Data-Analysis.git
   cd KMPG-Data-Analysis
   ```

2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
   ```

3. Open `KPMG.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run the analysis.

4. Use `Dashboard.pbix` to open the Power BI dashboard for visualization.

## Data Analysis Steps

### Data Loading
- Reads multiple sheets from the Excel file using pandas.

### Data Exploration
- Displays first few rows.
- Checks for missing values and data types.

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handles missing values.
- Converts data types.
- Merges datasets for unified analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics.
- Visualizations to understand trends in transactions and customer behavior.

### Dashboard Development
- Prepares data for Power BI.
- Key insights: customer segmentation, revenue trends, high-value customer identification, business recommendations.
